### Lyrics
```
When I was just a little boy
Before my heart grew this cold
I didn't know you
And you lived somewhere else

But he's the one who fell in love
I'm someone else from down below
I get the job done

But you're my baby
My baby
You're a diamond in the rough
I know you'll break my heart again
And again and again
Just to know if I love you

But just when I thought I'd let you go
Settling in for the final blow
Look who changed his mind 
When he thought about it

Like a pen run out of ink
And a coat that won't quite fit
We just go on we don't think about that


Baby, you're my baby
Still a diamond in the rough
Can't you hear your own heart pound
When stand-in angels come around
Can't you see why they love you

(Bridge)

So let your hammers ring
And gain insight in the things
That we celebrate
Like a book that makes us sweat
Words we catch like fish in nets
Go on don't think about it

Baby, you're my baby
Still a diamond in the rough
I know you will break my heart again
And again and again
Just to see if I love you
```
