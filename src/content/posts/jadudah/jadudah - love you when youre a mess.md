Capo: nth fret

A

F#m     D                C#m    C#
Oh your hands moves like waves
F#m     D                C#m      C#
    The sweat is dripping from your neck 
F#m                  D                C#m              C#
I've seen you in a hundred different shades and shapes
F#m     D                C#m             C#
Fake until there's nothing left to fake

F#m    D      C#m
Lalala lalala lalalala
F#m    D      C#m
Lalala lalala lalalala


F#m                C#            D           C#
Why don't you just throw out yesterdays dress
F#m        C#              D    C#
I've never seen you like this

D    A    E 
E
I love you when you're such a mess
D    A    E
C#
I love you when you're such a mess


Oh your hands moves like waves
And I'm one with the ocean, what a cold embrace
Oh you speak in such a mesmerizing way
Take until there's nothing left to take

Lalala lalala lalalala
Lalala lalala lalalala

Why don't you just throw out all the rest
I only want to see you like this
I love you when you're such a mess
I love you when you're such a mess
I love you when you're such a mess
I love you when you're such a mess

Bridge: 
Bm Em A#

D             E                   F#m
And all those preachers, how they preach for you
D             E                      F#m
And all those beggars, how they beg for you
D        E                      F#m
I'm a dreamer, and I dream of you
D             E                      C#
And all those beggars they should beg for you

F#m                C#            D           C#
Why don't you just throw out yesterdays dress
I only want to see you like this

D    A    E
E
I love you when you're such a mess
I love you when you're such a mess
I love you when you're such a mess
I love you when you're such a mess

D
