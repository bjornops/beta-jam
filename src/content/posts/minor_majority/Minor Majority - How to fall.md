Am Em x 2

Am
You

Am                             Em
You taught me how to raise the stakes
Em                    F
How to punch above my weight
           G                    Am
You're not here to see me fail

Am
And you
Am                             Em
you taught me how to shake the blame
Em                               F
You told me how I would stay the same
          G                               Am
to keep a straight face with the weakest hand


Dm            F          G     Am
But you never taught me how to fall
               G                      Dm
How to keep on running when I loose control
Dm         F         G     F    C    Dm
You never taught me how to fall


Am                           Em
You told me about the golden rule
Em                               F
The girlfriend and the swimming pool
F                          G
How they look at what you got
                Am
not at what you do


Am
And you 
                         Em
you taught me how not to overspend
                                    F
How to trust them and you can't be friends
               G
always me and you
              Am
never us and them

Dm            F          G     Am
But you never taught me how to fall
Am             G                    Dm
How to keep my cool at the curtain call
Dm        F          G     Am
You never taught me how to fall
Am                         G
I was made for exceptions
            F    Dm
not come at all
Dm       Am
mmmm 
F       Dm     Am
fall


[Solo]
Am Em x2


Dm            F          G     Am
But you never taught me how to fall
                     G
And I chose to love you in spite of all your flaws
Dm        F         G       Am
You never taught me how to fall
               G
How to keep on running when I lost it all
Dm            F     G      F   C   Dm
You never taught me how to fa-all


[Outro]
Am Am F Dm
