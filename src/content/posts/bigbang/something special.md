Intro:
F  G  Am  Am  x4

              F                    G                 
Did you ever write my name with a fountain pen
Am
In your books or on your desk
 
did you tell your friends
     F  G                Am
That I      was someone special
        F                    G
Did you ever lie awake the entire night
Am 
Glowing in the dark with no sheets or light
               F G               Am
Thinking that I     was someone special

G              F
   You got me running
                 G
running late at night
           Am
trying to find you
G                   F
    And I started thinking
                  G
thinking all the time
             Am
what could I do

F           G       Am
    I had something for you
F              G            Am
    Was there something for me
F          G            Am
    I had something to give you
F               G   Am
    But it's a mystery

Did you ever change your clothes did you hesitate
walking back and forth, always being late
Cause I was someone special
Did you ever take a shower did you wash your face
making up the bed thinking just incase
That I was someone special

You got me running
running late at night
trying to find you
And I started thinking
thinking all the time
what could I do

I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But now it`s mystery

F G Am x4

You got me running
running late at night
trying to find you
And I started thinking
thinking all the time
But what could I do

I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery
I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery

 G                  Am
Something special
