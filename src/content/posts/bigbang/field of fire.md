Capo 4. b√•nd

```
   G                    G
In sheets of gold under autumn skies,
   Em7                  Em7
on top of the world the happy prince cries.

C
Another tear
Cadd9
in a voice only a swallow can hear.

          G            G
Could you help me now, get things right.
        Em7                        Em7
Take my sapphire eyes, fly off and hand them out.
Cadd9
We're not the only ones.

Pre-chorus  

Em9
We feel lost and get carried away,
Am
when we listen to what our friends say.

Em9
We walk the earth like a man on a wire,
Am
while kids run in a field of fire

Cadd9
What can we do

Ref:
         G                       G
when the world comes knocking to remind us of
    Em                                   Em7
our lives are fragile and could end just so.
C               Cadd9 C             Cadd9
could happen to you,  and happen to me.

           G                    G
Covered in sheets of gold under autumn skies,
   Em                   Em
on top of the world the happy prince cries.
C                        C
You're not the only one, we're not the only one.


Em9
We try to hide behind the song,
Am
the story's old and the words are wrong

Em9
And the guarantee to bring you right down,
Am
so love your heart more than your crown.
C                 Cadd9 C          Cadd9
you don't have to sing, or say any thing.

C                        C
You're not the only one, we're not the only one.


Solo
