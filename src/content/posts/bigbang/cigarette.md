Bm i 7. b√•nd

```
Bm
her name is cigarette
and i can't quit
'guess i'm the malboro man
she likes my west and shirt
more than my cowoy boots
i saw her put it on this morning
G               A
I was lying in bed
G                         A
stealing looks in her silouhette

Bm
smoking a cigarette
we ain't finished yet
you've come a long way baby
i'm a tobaccoman
not a medicine clown
i walk a mile for your camel
G                    A
oh darling put on a film
G                          A
and make the room that we like to hide in
Em
uuuh...
Bm
na na nanana na na.
no need to talk
and here we go again
right now, baby well, right now
couldn't care less
what the people have said
G                     
fire, babe we're on fire
            A
and all i want is one more day
Em
with you

Bm
Smoking a cigarette
a little russian roulette
we keep on spinning
what's all this about?
when i thought i was out
you pull me back in
i might not be boyfriend material
but i'm different from the hang out with
if that's what you are looking for now
the two of us can be a hit
G                     A
well baby put on a film
G                   A
like we're gonna watch the whole thing
Em
uuuh...
Bm
na na....
no need to talk
and here we go again
right now, baby well, right now
couldn't care less
what the people have said
G
fire, babe we're on fire
           A         
and all i want is one more day
Em
with you....
