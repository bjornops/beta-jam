## Chords

```
Em   D                           Em 
    When you get up in the morning 
G                             D 
while you work 'till late at night 
Am                     C                D 
as you sit alone and watch some movie about 
                    Am            Em 
guys who love to fight(same chords) 

She will take off all her make-up, 
brush her teeth and go to bed 
fall asleep and dream you laid your hand 
upon her head 

Hm                 Am              G               D 
Do you hear the callin' from a sidetrack of your mind? 
Am               C               D                Am         Em 
singin' back in vocals to the sound of your busy line 

You will sit in front of the paper 
sort your feelings if you can 
but no matter what you think you are you're no 
Long Distance Man 

Then you'll go out and stand there laughin' 
pretend you're having fun 
getting used to people saying 
"Look what you've done" 

Do you hear the callin' [...]

Twice as alone when you're together 
faking smiles and holding hands 
each one guided only by their own 
fears and demands 

And together you walk in silence 
not knowing what to say 
what was I thinking about 
the other day? 

Solo 

Do you hear the callin' [...]

When you get up in the morning 
while you work 'till late at night 
as you sit alone and watch 
you fall asleep in your Hollywood light
