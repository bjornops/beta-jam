Capo 2. bånd

```
Em
If your heart breaks
Tear it apart
If your mind fails
Give it a start

Am
Everything you need underneath your shoe
C
Pick up the pieces and fix it with glue
Am                    C
Believe in the dream
Em
Like americans do

Em
If you lost your job
Tell me about it
If you had a sweet drunken father
Shout it out

Am
Old scars make this friendship true
C
I’m not too proud to wait for you
Am                    C
Or to believe in this
Em
… like americans do

Em
Love is lonely like a Saturday night
Or your Sunday’s best torn in a fight
Am
Dancing with mirrors to the devils tunes
C
Loners in the neon, just a chosen few
Am			    C
Believing they’re saved
  Em
… Like americans do


If your heart breaks
Tear it apart
If your mind fails
Need a new start

Everything you need underneath your shoe
I’m not too proud to wait for you
Or to believe in this or pretend to
Like americans do

Love is lonely like a Saturday night
Or your Sunday’s best torn in a fight
Dancing with mirrors to the devils tunes
Loners in the neon, just a chosen few
Believing they’re saved
Believing they’re saved
… like americans do

Em Am C Am C x2
