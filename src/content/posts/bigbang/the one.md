## Chords

B A G (A-E-B) A# F# B

```
B
Thinking about your breakup
G
While I’m on the train
B
Words flowing over
G
And into the rain

B – G – B – G 

B
Just a boy
A
By the window, with no name
B
A train speeding by another
G
Non-stop town again

B                   G
I’m not the one for you
B                                 G
You know that i’m not the one for you
And here’s what i could do

B                            A
One, two: walk up to your door
A
Three, four: can i crash on your floor?
G                   A                 E   B
Five, six, seven, won’t you wanna see me again?

Little girls in the mirror
And soldiers in the mist
All trying to be a little
Harder to resist
But baby your not the one for me
I know that you’re not the one for me

[solo]

But here’s what I could do

One, two, walk up to your door
Three, four, can I crash on your floor?
Five, six, seven, I would wanna see you again
Ah
One, two, walk up to your door
Three, four, can I crash on your floor?
Five, six, seven, I would wanna see you again

[Modulate to A#, F#, B]

And more than I maybe wanted
You got your new york love, baby
A pain already forgotten
A love already made

walking up to your door
roll around on your floor
Again and again and again and again and again

And more than I maybe wanted
And do you wanna see me again?
