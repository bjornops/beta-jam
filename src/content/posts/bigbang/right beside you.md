Verse 2:
Been to a city, a city for real
with 120's and cosmopolitan feel
and you are feeling good
you've got that - it's understood

You've been crossing long bridges and walking steep hills
You've got yourself a groove with excellent fills
And stories told, now they're getting rather old

And now you're here, you're sitting right beside someone who is
waiting for a better way, to put it in another way
I'll sing a song for you, I'll sing a song for you
