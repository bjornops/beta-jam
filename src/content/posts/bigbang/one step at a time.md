One step at a time

just a minute

A minute and I'll be on my way

One step at a time

I'll tear the whole thing down

F – G – Em
Ah..

Am
One step at a time
Am
From inside the stones
			G
We sound like most pathetic things
Chasing crowns and rings
When we could be living
Am
One step at a time
Am
One step at a time
		F
We battle out another round
			   G
We almost lose our minds
			Em
Just to feel something

F – G – Am

Ah..

Am
One step at a time
One step at a time
F
Like the stuff we love
Great and almost done

Until the sun comes up
	Em		Am
Or the real thing comes along
