Intro: Em C Em x4

Em               C                 Em
Can't think of a reason you should stay
Em                C                   Em
I've prepared for nothing but nothing came


Bm              E
Someone always cares
A
Make it all just disappear
F          Dm
Past your guard under your skin
Am              G
Into your life and out again
F        E                 Am
Into the dark as the earth spins


Em           C                 Em
The craziest thing you made me do
Em             C                     Em
was to make me think i could be like you


Bm    E
Im in [...]
A                            F
You know now just where I've been
F           Dm                    Am
Past their guard under their skin
Am    G                       F
You disappear if I let you in
F         Dm                  Am
Into my life and there within
Am        G
miniature him to stick your pins in
F              E                     Am
you'll be around when the night begins


[Solo]
Em C Em


Em               C                Em
Used to feel so good just wasting time
Em               C                    Em
We used to go so fast, used to get so high

Em              C                  Em
As beautifully float like butterflies
G         Am                    C
throw our punches at the open sky

Bm         E
I'll be on [...]
A                      F
How come you won't disappear?
F        Dm                       Am
Guess I hope in that time you'll see
Am         G                    F
I need you whispering behind me

F        Dm          Am
Once I step into the light
Am              G                    F
I [possess] the shadows that I fight
F            Dm                      Am
My hands can hit but my eyes can't see
Am               G                                F
They won't take [count] as long as you're with me
F                    Dm                    Am
So there's a million reasons I should call
Am            G                       F
It's never as easy as just letting go
F        E               Am
Never as easy as letting go
```
