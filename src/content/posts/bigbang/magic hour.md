## Chords

Capo: 3rd fret
Vers: B-A-G-A
Ref. : E-Bm

```
Intro: B-A-G-A

Bm            A                G
      Tell me something that I won’t remember
         A
And I’ll find a way to laugh
Crack jokes about our broken past

B          A             G
  Leave my doorstep in a cloud of smoke
    A
And rabbish all confused 
was a black cape and the magic words they used

Maybe there’s a brighter future
Where people stay together,
But I don’t know how they get there

Em
         Magic hour
Skies are golden blue
	      Bm
And we’re happy now, not knowing

Em
Magic hour,
Skies are golden blue,
	Bm		    G?       A
But it might be time for going

I’ll tell you something that I DO remember
A single strand of hair
A proof that you were really there

We were living in a cloud of smoke
Followed our believes
We had aces up our sleeves

Maybe there’s a bright future
Imagined it together
Messed up trying to get there

Magic hour
Skies are golden blue
And we’re happy now, not knowing
Magic hour
Skies are golden blue
But it might be time for going

Tell me something that I won’t remember
With the wave of your magic wand,
You decided to move on
