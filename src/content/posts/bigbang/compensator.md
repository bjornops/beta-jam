```
Intro: 
Am Dm E/F Am x 2

Am Dm E/F Am

Am                                 Dm
Now here's a trevelling song going nowhere
         F                         Am
and I'll tell you how to get there fast

Am                   Dm
Keep on moving every dark night
   F                                  Am
Be scared of every love that feels so right

Am   Dm
ooo ah
F                 Am
Always liked her
Am   Dm
ooo ah
F
Always loved her

Am Dm E Am x2

         Am          Dm
I didn't say I never told her
     E                         Am
Just don't know how to go that way

        Am               Dm
And she dived in deep so quickly
  E                    Am
I hardly even knew her name

Am
We write the truth
We get to choose 
Dm
We find somebody else to lose
E             Am
Compensator

Am
Score the goal
Get the prize
Dm
You hit right me right between the eyes
E              Am
Compensator

Verse:
       F
Well I don't know how to begin
  G
I don't know how to let love in
A
Compensator

      F
And I just can't look you in the eye
   G
In case you seeing what I hide
A
Compensator
