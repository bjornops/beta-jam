____________________________________________________________________

Was it all worth waiting for

It was always out of sight
     G
But once upon a time
     C
When we were doing fine
     G          C
We were all together
  G    
Hiding under sheets
     C
Or laughing in the streets
          G         C
We were something better


      B              F           G
But now I see the reflection of my face
 D                  C  B
Running down your cheekbone

I see the reflection of my face

Running down your cheekbone



Trying to make the best of the situation

Trying to make you feel alright

My little moves all around you

In the darkness or in the light

We had a place to go

In fifty years or so

We would be getting older

Driving in the rain

We slowly felt the pain

We were just growing colder
